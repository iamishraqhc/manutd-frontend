This is a practice project. I have created an API which consists of the player details of Manchester United Football Club. So in this project, I am fetching data from that API and rendering in the web browser.

I don't hold the right to any content I used here as all are reserved rights of Manchester United.

The public API is: https://manutd-players.herokuapp.com/players
